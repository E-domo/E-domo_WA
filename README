E-Domo is a web application that is made to allow users, depending on their credentials, to view recipes. 
It gives the public access to meals, their ingredients, and cooking steps to allow them to cook healthy home-cooked meals in an attempt to boost nutrition or spice their lives up.
The team used HTML5, CSS, JS, and PHP to build the application.
We intend to implement an event page and subscription services later on.
You can view the site at the following IP
3.10.53.28
or you can download and host the files locally. You must import the SQL file in phpmyadmin for the web app to be functional.
